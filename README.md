# KeyboardPulser
 
Hello everyone,

I'm GhostNemesis12, but you can call me Nemesis. I'm excited to introduce you to a simple yet unique program I've developed. Surprisingly, despite its simplicity, I couldn't find anything quite like it available for download online. Perhaps it's because scripting this action is so straightforward, or maybe it's because it's not perceived as particularly useful. Regardless, I've decided to formalize it into a user-friendly program.

This program allows you to simulate key presses on your keyboard indefinitely, until you decide to stop. While detailed instructions are provided within the program itself, I'll also include them here for your convenience.
