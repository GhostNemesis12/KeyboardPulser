# KeyboardPulser
 
Hello everyone,

I'm GhostNemesis12, but you can call me Nemesis. I'm excited to introduce you to a simple yet unique program I've developed. Surprisingly, despite its simplicity, I couldn't find anything quite like it available for download online. Perhaps it's because scripting this action is so straightforward, or maybe it's because it's not perceived as particularly useful. Regardless, I've decided to formalize it into a user-friendly program for Windows.

This program allows you to simulate key presses on your keyboard indefinitely, until you decide to stop. While detailed instructions are provided within the program itself, I'll also include them here for your convenience.
The name "KeyboardPulser" isn't a mistake; rather, it's a deliberate choice I made for the program, aiming for originality.
Instructions (are also in the program):
-In the text box "Enter key" you will insert the key you want to repeat from your keyboard.
-In the text box "Start Key" insert the key you want to start the process with.
-In the text box "Stop Key" you will insert the key with which you want to stop the process.
-Start" and "Stop" activate and stop the process respectively.
-Don't forget to press "Save" always before starting the process.
-Reset" allows you to reset the text boxes.
-To use the stop hotkey you must to double press the selected key or hold it 1 second
